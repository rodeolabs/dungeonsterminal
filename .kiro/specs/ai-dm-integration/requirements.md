# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current mock AI responses with real AI integration to create a truly intelligent Dungeon Master. The system currently has a complete terminal interface, dashboard, and character management system, but uses placeholder responses. This integration will transform the prototype into a working AI DM that can generate dynamic narratives, handle complex player interactions, and maintain campaign continuity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AI DM to provide real, intelligent responses to my actions, so that I can experience dynamic storytelling instead of pre-written mock responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player types any action THEN the AI DM SHALL generate contextually appropriate responses using OpenAI or Anthropic APIs
2. WHEN a player performs combat actions THEN the AI SHALL apply D&D 5e rules and generate narrative descriptions
3. WHEN a player explores THEN the AI SHALL create unique location descriptions and encounters
4. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to enhanced mock responses with clear indication
5. WHEN generating responses THEN the AI SHALL maintain consistency with previous narrative elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AI DM to remember our campaign history and character relationships, so that the story feels continuous and my choices have lasting impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new session THEN the AI SHALL load and reference previous campaign events
2. WHEN interacting with NPCs THEN the AI SHALL remember past conversations and relationship changes
3. WHEN making story decisions THEN the AI SHALL reference and build upon previous player choices
4. IF campaign memory becomes too large THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize older events
5. WHEN multiple sessions occur THEN the AI SHALL maintain narrative continuity across all sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AI DM to enforce D&D 5e rules accurately, so that the game feels authentic and balanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN combat occurs THEN the AI SHALL apply correct initiative, attack rolls, and damage calculations
2. WHEN using spells THEN the AI SHALL enforce spell slot consumption and concentration rules
3. WHEN making skill checks THEN the AI SHALL use appropriate DCs and modifiers
4. IF rule conflicts arise THEN the AI SHALL explain the ruling and apply it consistently
5. WHEN leveling up THEN the AI SHALL guide players through proper advancement rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want fast AI responses during gameplay, so that the narrative flow isn't interrupted by long waiting times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting AI responses THEN the system SHALL return responses within 3 seconds for 90% of requests
2. WHEN generating complex narratives THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators or progress feedback
3. WHEN AI processing takes longer THEN the system SHALL provide interim responses to maintain engagement
4. IF response time exceeds 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL offer to continue with cached content
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL cache frequently used content and responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AI DM to handle unclear or ambiguous input gracefully, so that I can focus on storytelling without worrying about precise command syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN player input is ambiguous THEN the AI SHALL ask for clarification while staying in character
2. WHEN multiple interpretations are possible THEN the AI SHALL suggest options and let the player choose
3. WHEN player intent is unclear THEN the AI SHALL make reasonable assumptions and explain its interpretation
4. IF player input contains errors THEN the AI SHALL understand the intent and respond appropriately
5. WHEN handling edge cases THEN the AI SHALL maintain immersion while resolving confusion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust AI service abstraction layer, so that we can switch between different AI providers and handle service failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating AI services THEN the system SHALL support both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
2. WHEN one AI service fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup providers
3. WHEN configuring AI settings THEN the system SHALL allow model selection and parameter tuning
4. IF all AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use enhanced local responses
5. WHEN monitoring AI usage THEN the system SHALL track costs, response times, and quality metrics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the AI DM to integrate seamlessly with the existing dashboard and terminal interface, so that all game information updates in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates responses THEN character stats SHALL update automatically in the dashboard
2. WHEN combat occurs THEN HP, spell slots, and conditions SHALL sync in real-time
3. WHEN inventory changes THEN the dashboard SHALL reflect updates immediately
4. IF AI suggests dice rolls THEN the system SHALL integrate with the dice rolling system
5. WHEN narrative events occur THEN quest logs and location information SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and error handling for AI integration, so that I can maintain service quality and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN monitoring AI performance THEN the system SHALL track response times, success rates, and costs
3. WHEN AI responses are inappropriate THEN the system SHALL have content filtering and safety measures
4. IF AI usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and cost controls
5. WHEN analyzing AI quality THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on response relevance and player satisfaction
