# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Grok AI (X.AI) into our AI Dungeon Master terminal interface. The goal is to create a production-ready AI integration that provides intelligent, context-aware responses for tabletop RPG gameplay, replacing any mock implementations with real AI capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want to interact with Grok AI through a terminal interface, so that I can get intelligent responses and assistance during my D&D sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the terminal interface THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and prompt for input
2. WHEN a user types a message and presses enter THEN the system SHALL send the message to Grok AI and display the response
3. WHEN the Grok API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
4. WHEN a user types "exit" or "quit" THEN the system SHALL gracefully close the terminal interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure API key management for Grok AI, so that credentials are protected and the system can authenticate properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load the Grok API key from environment variables
2. IF no API key is found THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with setup instructions
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
4. WHEN API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want conversation history to be preserved, so that the AI can maintain context throughout our session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty conversation history
2. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL store both user input and AI responses
3. WHEN sending requests to Grok AI THEN the system SHALL include relevant conversation context
4. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL optionally save conversation history to Supabase

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL log stack traces and continue operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the AI to understand RPG context and terminology, so that responses are relevant and helpful for tabletop gaming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the AI THEN the system SHALL provide D&D-specific system prompts
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the AI SHALL recognize RPG terminology and concepts
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the AI SHALL maintain appropriate tone and style for D&D sessions
4. WHEN asked about rules or mechanics THEN the AI SHALL provide accurate D&D 5e information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the integration is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all core functionality SHALL be covered with at least 80% code coverage
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN API interactions SHALL be tested with mock responses
3. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN the complete user workflow SHALL be validated
4. WHEN tests fail THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the specific failure point
